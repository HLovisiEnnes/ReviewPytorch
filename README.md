# ReviewPytorch
A 12-days long review of Pytorch, Hugging Face, and evaluation of LLM. Loosely based on some books and repositories; the original code of each of the days is indicated below.
The notebooks are separated into days, each with a particular topic.

1. Day 1: [review of Pytorch basics](nootebooks/Day01.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
2. Day 2: [simple NLP classification with MLP](nootebooks/Day02.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
3. Day 3: [apprimaoration of NLP classification with MLP](nootebooks/Day03.ipynb)
4. Day 4: [Hugging Face and Transformers](nootebooks/Day04.ipynb) (mostly based of [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers))
5. Day 5: [RNN for classification](nootebooks/Day05.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
6. Day 6: [RNN for text generation](nootebooks/Day06.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
7. Day 7: [LLM Eval](nootebooks/Day07.ipynb) (based on the [DeepEval library](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)) 
8. Day 8: [Summarization](nootebooks/Day08.ipynb) (mostly based of [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers))
9. Day 9: [Question and answering 1 (general architecture)](nootebooks/Day09.ipynb) (mostly based of [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers))
10. Day 10: Question and answering 2 (fine-tuning and RAG) (this one has two versions, one for [haystack v1](nootebooks/Day10v1.ipynb) -- fine-tuning -- and one for [haystack v2](nootebooks/Day10v1.ipynb)) (mostly based of [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers))
11. Day 11: [Miniproject 1: AG News classification](nootebooks/Day11.ipynb)
12. Day 12: [Miniproject 2: Trivia QA](nootebooks/Day11.ipynb)
