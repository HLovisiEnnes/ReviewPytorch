# ReviewPytorch
Week long review of Pytorch. Loosely based on [Rao and McMahan (2019)](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master) and [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf (2022)](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers).

The notebooks are separated into days, each with a particular topic.

1. Day 1: [review of Pytorch basics](Day1.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
2. Day 2: [simple NLP classification with MLP](Day2.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
3. Day 3: [apprimaoration of NLP classification with MLP](Day3.ipynb)
4. Day 4: [Hugging Face and Transformers](Day4.ipynb) (mostly based of [Tunstall, von Werra, and Wolf](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers))
5. Day 5: [RNN for classification](Day5.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
6. Day 6: [RNN for text generation](Day6.ipynb) (mostly based of [Rao and McMahan](https://github.com/delip/PyTorchNLPBook/tree/master))
